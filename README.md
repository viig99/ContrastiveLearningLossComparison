# Contrastive Learning Loss Comparision

This repository is to compare the performance of different contrastive learning loss functions on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The following loss functions are compared:
* InfoNCE Loss
* NT-Xent Loss (SimCLR)
* DCL Loss (Decoupled Contrastive Learning)
* DHEL Loss (Decoupled Hypershperical Energy Loss)
